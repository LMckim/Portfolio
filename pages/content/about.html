        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <br>
        <p>
                My name is Luke Mckim and I am an aspiring developer from Toronto, Ontatio.
            This site was created using my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
            and PHP. The server it runs on is my own raspberry pi 3 B+running raspbian with an Nginx web server configured
            to run with php-fpm7.2. The entire backend of the site is pure PHP.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
                I am currently looking for a job within the tech industry. My main focus is building backend
            structures to support websites and maintain databases.
