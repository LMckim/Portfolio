        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My name is Luke Mckim and I am an aspiring developer from Toronto, Ontario.
            This site was created using my skills in HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, jQuery
            and PHP. The server it runs on is my own Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running a raspbian-stretch lite image with an Nginx web server configured
            to run with php-fpm7.1. The entire backend of the site is a simple templating engine I created with pure PHP.
            Originally the site was created with Bootstrap but after running into problems I decided to move to CSS compiled using Sass
            so that I could better understand how to properly build a website before using a framework.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Currently my objective is to find a entry-level job within the Tech industry.
