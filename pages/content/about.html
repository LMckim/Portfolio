        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there,</p>
        <br>
        <p>
                My name is Luke Mckim and I am an aspiring developer from Toronto, Ontatio.
            This site was created using my skills in Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
            and PHP. The server it runs on is Ubuntu based with an Nginx web server configured
            to run with php-fpm7.2.  The entire backend of the site is pure PHP.
        </p>
        <p>
                I am currently looking for a job within the tech industry. My main focus is building backend
            structures to support websites and maintain databases.
